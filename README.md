# BannerAdditions
BannerAdditions adds more banner patterns to Minecraft (1.16.1)!
Since Minecraft is dumb and all of the banner patterns are hard coded, I decided to redo some parts of the system. Now, you can add your own banner patterns via resource pack!
This mod is still in beta, so I recommend you use this mod with caution.

## Features
### Overview
- ✔ More banner patterns.
- ✔ More than 6 patterns on a banner (now 12).
- ✔ Banner Pattern Items can have more than one pattern on them.
- ✔ Shield support.
- ✔ (Sort of) easy custom banner patterns (with datapacks and resource packs).
- ✔ Animated banner patterns.

### Details
BannerAdditions adds some banner patterns by default. There are currently only a couple, but more will be added in the future.<br><br>

Most of the patterns can be found in the loom without any pattern item. However the sword patterns require the sword pattern item which can be crafted like so:<br><br>

Along with this, some of the normal banner pattern recipes have gotten less expensive.<br><br>
