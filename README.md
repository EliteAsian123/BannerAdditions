# BannerAdditions
BannerAdditions adds more banner patterns to Minecraft (1.16.1)! **This mod is still in development and is not recommeneded that you use it until it is finished.**

# Features (and Planned Features)
- ✔️ Added banner patterns (currently only Checker)
- ✔️ Banner Pattern Items can have more than one pattern on them.
- ❌ Shields with banners.
- ❌ Animated banner patterns.
- ❌ Easy custom banners (probably with datapacks or something).
- ❓ 1.15 versions?

# How to Install
Currently, you have to compile the mod yourself, but once I am done adding shields with banners back in, I will provide a jar. I will also eventually put it on CurseForge.
