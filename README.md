# BannerAdditions
BannerAdditions adds more banner patterns to Minecraft (1.16.1)!
Since Minecraft is dumb and all of the banner patterns are hard coded, I decided to redo some parts of the system. Now, you can add your own banner patterns via resource pack!
This mod is still in beta, so I recommend you use this mod with caution.

# Features
### Overview
- ✔ More banner patterns.
- ✔ More than 6 patterns on a banner (now 12).
- ✔ Banner Pattern Items can have more than one pattern on them.
- ✔ Shield support.
- ✔ (Sort of) easy custom banner patterns (with datapacks and resource packs).
- ✔ Animated banner patterns.

### Details
BannerAdditions adds some banner patterns by default. There are currently only a couple, but more will be added in the future.<br><br>

The checkerboard pattern and the horizontal paly pattern can be found in the loom without any pattern item. However the sword patterns require the sword pattern item which can be crafted like so:<br><br>

Along with this, some of the normal banner pattern recipes have gotten less expensive.<br><br>

There are also animated banner patterns (sorry for the bad quality)<br><br>
